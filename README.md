This is a simple example that strips out a lot of generally accepted architectural components and other proclaimed best practices. It is using the minimum of dependencies, frameworks and libraries in order to avoid obscuring the illustration of using the Hilt dependency injection library. 

##### Branches:

"complete" branch is the example/tutorial application where the "magic"üòÄ happens. ***It appears you are currently on this branch.***

##### This example demonstrates/teaches:

- Compose Navigation Drawer

##### This example also includes/uses:

- Kotlin
- Compose
- Navigation
- Navigation Drawer

### How to best use this demo:

The starting point of this app was the template for a new project in Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 called ‚ÄúEmpty Compose Activity‚Äù and using Kotlin. You can create an empty project based on that template and compare it to this project to discern what needs to be done to get your project started with using a Navigation Drawer in compose.
